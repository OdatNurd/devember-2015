This project constitutes my entry into Devember 2015. See <http://devember.org>
for more information. There is an associated development log at
<http://bloggity.nurdz.com/category/devember2015/> as per the rules of Devember.

This is a port of a dirt simple JavaScript "engine" that I'm currently using to
prototype game ideas to TypeScript. I've never used the language at all before
(basically I'm just peripherally aware that it exists) but as a language that
transpiles to JavaScript it seems interesting.

Once the port is complete I will work a bit on a game prototype idea I've been
kicking around, so I can fully evaluate the workflow and see if it makes things
easier or harder.
