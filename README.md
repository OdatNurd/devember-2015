This project constitutes my entry into Devember 2015. See <http://devember.org>
for more information. There is an associated development log at
<http://bloggity.nurdz.com/category/devember2015/> as per the rules of Devember.

This branch (rx) is a fork of the master branch that takes the code in the
direction of using the ported engine to prototype some or all of a simple
Dr. Mario clone, which I'm calling Rx because clever.
