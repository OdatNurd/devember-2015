This project constitutes my entry into Devember 2015. See <http://devember.org>
for more information. There is an associated development log at
<http://bloggity.nurdz.com/category/devember2015/> as per the rules of Devember.

This branch (engine) is a fork of the master branch that contains only the pure
engine code with no other changes made to it. This is so that when Devember is
over, if I decide that I want to keep using TypeScript I have a known clean
commit to fork from.
